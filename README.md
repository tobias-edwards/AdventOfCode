## Comparing solutions

I want to build a UI that compares people's solutions and benchmarks them. See `feat/visualiser` branch for progress, feel free to help, add ideas, etc.

Ideas:
- Compare raw code (side-by-side view?)
- Graphically represent user solutions, whether they've completed, etc.
- Benchmark solutions:
  - Will be tricky because people use different languages, this also means comparisons between different languages will depend on compilers etc.
- Maybe have a place to like/comment on other solutions? Ratings on readability/elegance/speed?
